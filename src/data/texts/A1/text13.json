In winter we protect equipment from freezing. Sprayer calibration prevents over application. We rotate pastures to improve forage quality. We record yields and monitor feed intake. I feed cows and check plants. Irrigation is scheduled to reduce water waste. We start work before sunrise during harvest.",
