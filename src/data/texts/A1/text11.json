Veterinary biosecurity keeps the herd healthy. The tractor needs a safety check before operation. Irrigation is scheduled to reduce water waste. We record yields and monitor feed intake. I work on a farm. Sprayer calibration prevents over application. We water animals and fix tools. We start work before sunrise during harvest. I feed cows and check plants. Farm safety rules are part of our routine. I clean the barn after milking. I start the tractor carefully.",
