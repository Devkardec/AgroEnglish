Irrigation is scheduled to reduce water waste. The tractor needs a safety check before operation. The greenhouse helps control temperature and humidity. I adjust irrigation when the soil is dry. I use simple tools for daily tasks. Sprayer calibration prevents over application. We rotate pastures to improve forage quality. We follow safety steps in the barn. Farm safety rules are part of our routine. We start work before sunrise during harvest. In winter we protect equipment from freezing.",
