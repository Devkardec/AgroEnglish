The tractor needs a safety check before operation. Farm safety rules are part of our routine. In winter we protect equipment from freezing. The greenhouse helps control temperature and humidity. We start work before sunrise during harvest. Irrigation is scheduled to reduce water waste. Veterinary biosecurity keeps the herd healthy.",
