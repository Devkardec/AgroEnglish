Farm safety rules are part of our routine. In winter we protect equipment from freezing. Irrigation is scheduled to reduce water waste. We record yields and monitor feed intake. We rotate pastures to improve forage quality. This is my routine at the dairy farm. We follow safety steps in the barn. Sprayer calibration prevents over application. We start work before sunrise during harvest. The greenhouse helps control temperature and humidity. I adjust irrigation when the soil is dry.",
