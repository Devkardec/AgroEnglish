We follow safety steps in the barn. We start work before sunrise during harvest. Irrigation is scheduled to reduce water waste. This is my routine at the dairy farm. The greenhouse helps control temperature and humidity. Veterinary biosecurity keeps the herd healthy. The tractor needs a safety check before operation. Sprayer calibration prevents over application. We record yields and monitor feed intake. Farm safety rules are part of our routine. I use simple tools for daily tasks.",
